# Project README

## Contribution Overview

In this project, I have contributed by integrating a CryptoAPIs connector, significantly enhancing the application's functionality. This connector provides the project with direct access to comprehensive market data and transaction fees information. Through this integration, users can now obtain real-time insights into cryptocurrency market trends and make informed decisions based on transaction costs. This addition enriches the project's data sources, offering a broader perspective on the cryptocurrency market.
